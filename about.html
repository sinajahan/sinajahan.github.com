            Hi there!
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm Sina. I'm a developer and I like what I do.

            I earned my Bachelor's in CS from Tehran SBU and My Postgraduate from RMIT in Melbourne. In mid-2010 I moved to Toronto and I love this city.

            If you are reading this you probably want to know what kind of a person I am. I have been doing software prefessionally (i.e. for money) for about ten years. I have moved between .NET to Java and Ruby stacks a couple of times. I have done mosltly web and a some mobile. I have also tried companies from 2 person dev shop in a basement to a 2k employee enterprise with "Change Request Forms". I have had tons of fun at single product companies as well as consulting shops. During these years I have went into phases of love and hate about RUP, Agile, Design pattersn, SOA, XP and etc. I have a lot of passion for doing technolgy right and I know I am passed the phase of following buzzwords and hypes.
