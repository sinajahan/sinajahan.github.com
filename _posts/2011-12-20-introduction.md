Welcome to my blog. There are many many others like it,
but this one is mine.  I'm a developer who likes to build stuff. My background
is quite straightforward: I saw a computer for the first time when I was eight
and knew right I want to be a part of this. I got my own Commodore-64 at eight
and have been writing software systems since then. I initially thought I'd
go into academics but after my masters I started to build a passion around
building new products.

I am writing this blog as I find myself with a new way of thinking recently.
I have started to being more opinionated. My whole life I thought being middle
is the best strategy. You know when ever a subject comes up I was the guy who
 says the pro and cons. Recently I have started to hate this.

I think a lot being in the middle is a result of not having the courage to
stand behind your decision and accepting responsibility.

 Anyway...lets see how it goes :)
