Welcome to my blog. There are many many others like it,
but this one is mine!  My background
is quite straightforward: I saw a computer for the first time when I was eight
and knew right I want to be a part of this. I got my own Commodore-64 at eight
and have been playing with code since then. I initially thought I'd
go into academics but after my post grad I started to build a passion around
industry.

Recently, I have started to being more opinionated. My whole life I thought being middle
is the best strategy. You know when ever a subject comes up I was the guy who
 says the pro and cons. Recently I have started to not liking this.

I think a lot being in the middle is a result of not having the courage to
stand behind your decision and accepting responsibility.

 Anyway...lets see how it goes :)
