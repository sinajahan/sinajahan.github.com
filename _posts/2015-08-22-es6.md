title: Ready for ES6?
subtitle: Adoptation happened too fast on this one.

There is a lot of <a href="http://bdadam.com/blog/video-douglas-crockford-about-the-new-good-parts.html" target="_blank">content</a> around the good and bad parts of ES6 that I don't want duplicate here. We recently migrated our app and we had some concerns about how production ready ES6 really is, and how much mature tooling exists around it.

One way to communicate how ready we are with a technology is by using a <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/build-your-own-technology-radar" target="_blank">Tech Radar</a>.

We ran a survey and there was some inconsistency around where to put ES6. Some of our teams have put ES6 on trial and some on Adopt. As a reminder, the definition of Trial is:

> Worth pursuing. It is important to understand how to build up this capability. Enterprises should try this technology on a project that can handle the risk.

And the definition of Adopt:

> For technologies in the adopt ring, we strongly feel that the industry should be adopting these items. We use them where appropriate on our projects; as close to a "no-brainer" as possible.

#### Plenty of teams are in ES6 Adopt

We have clients from pharmaceutical companies to financial institutions that are already on
ES6. Teams in China, Australia, US and Europe have already made the
migration successfully in production. A lot of teams are using Babel and source code maps to support old browsers.

#### There are some team on ES6 Trial

At the same time some teams are putting ES6 on trial. Here are a couple of situations in which you may want to consider ES6 only on a non critical project:

* Non-vanilla JS code base: If you're already using a non-vanilla JS language like coffeescript or typescript.

* Lack of private NPM: A private NPM repository and the pre-publish step is a godsend for using transpilers in a large ecosystem, without which you can only write vanilla JavaScript or force all the consumers of your packages to install your transpilers too.

* Maybe a use case for not using ES6 is if you're building something open source (internal or external) and want the barrier to entry to be as low as possible. That used to be a motivation for using vanilla js rather than coffeescript. However today I think it's a tough argument to make for ES6. People who are not comfortable with it can just write ES5, and IMO it's very easy to pick up the few new bits of syntax enough that you can understand an ES6 codebase.

* Tooling: Tooling is lagging a little behind and doesn't yet support ES6 (e.g. static analysis - Plato)

* Pioneering challenges: Lack of patterns and good examples in the community. You'll often feel lonely struggling with a problem.

In the end none of above concerns were the case for out team and we made the migration successfully in less than an iteration.
