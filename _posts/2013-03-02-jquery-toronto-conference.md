================

We had tons of fun with hundreds of developers at the jQueryTO 2013
conference in downtown Toronto. It was my first week into this new job as we
went as a team. Nice welcome right there!

It was a 2-day conference that attracted the top coders in the city and a
stellar speaker lineup, which included Paul Irish and Addy Osmani from the
Chrome team and some of the biggest names in the jQuery developer community.

### Addy Osmani – Gone in 60 frames per second
I think he had the most interesting talk of the whole conference. He showed
us some tricks around scrolling performance and why it is important. He broke
Pintrest and did some cool hacks on CSS to fix it.

### Paul Irish The 2013 Frontend Disapora
He is still the coolest kid in the UI devs. He talked about new chrome
features.  I think a picture or a gif of him was included in half of the other
presentations. Showed some hacks on Chrome dev tools and gave us Google
T-Shirts! He made an apology about his post last year that raised a lot of
effort that went to waste.

### Dave Methvin on Jquery Foundation
He is the current president of jQuery foundation  ([twitter](https://twitter
.com/davemethvin)). He talked about new version of Jquery.
Asked us kindly to try the beta versions and provide feedback.
He mentioned how old web kit is the new IE. He talked about developers point
their production app to 'latest' jQeury version
and then complain about 'unsuitability'.

### Wes Bos Hardware Access and Device APIs with JavaScript and HTML5
He is a Toronto based hacker. I have seen him before in meetups and user
groups. He is wired for presentations for sure and we laughed a lot during
his talk. He hacked together a "post man detector" using a lot of extra
hardware and software.

### Darcy Clark Documenting Interfaces
He is the guy who put together the jqueryto.com website and was one of the
main guys of the event. He talked about how he tried to find a good tool
for UI docs and he wasn't able to find any so he started his own.

### Dan Heberden – Developing with Grunt
He is on the jQuery team too. Very interesting hacker. One of the presenters
cancelled two hours before his talk and he jumped on stage and presented that
guys talk. You can imagine how helpful it was to organizers. He talked about
Grunt and showed an example of how easy it is to setup.

### Monika Piotrowicz – The Dev Process
She works in an agency and talked about the hacks they have made in their
process to make their UI/developer process smoother. For example she mentioned
how they have moved desks and put dev with UI people closer to each other.

### Pearl Chen – AngularJS just ain’t another MVC framework
She talked about her experience with all these MVC frameworks and how angular
 is awesome in simplicity.

### Boaz Sender – Office Mobile Web App Architecture and Design
He works at Bocoup and talked about why mobile is important,
why we sould be careful as connection is always flaky,
how we can simply kill the battery and some design tips on
 optimizing your mobile app.

### Ross McKegney – The Future of the Web is 3D
He has started his company on the idea of 3D web. They have made some cool
stuff which he demoed. He also talked about how platforms like tree.js are
not as mature as they should be and how they are taking it to the next level.

### Derick Bailey – Scaling Backbone.js Applications with Marionette.js
He talked about the a library he has started to help backbonejs shops design
better apps. He was very opinionated and knew exactly what he was talking about
. He also criticized how the Rails world has got it wrong it the way they are
 putting views, models and controllers together as opposed to group them by
 user story.


### Ralph Holzmann – You Want Client Side Package Management
He has recently joined twitter team. He talked about Bower,
why other package managers don't work well and demoed
building a sample app using it.
