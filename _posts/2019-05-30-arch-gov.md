Did a talk at the Spaces office in collaboration with NewCo on architecture governance. Most of this content came out as we rolled out organizational changes for number of our clients around this subject.

### Abstract
Over the past 25 years, ThoughtWorks has been helping organizations shift from centralized control and planning to more adaptive approaches. We are seeing two different failure modes: the first is hierarchical command and control from ivory-tower architects and control gates; at the opposite end of the spectrum is chaos with every team doing whatever they want and close to zero governance. We will draw on ThoughtWorksâ€™ recent client experience to delve into some of the strategies and approaches for creating the right amount of lightweight governance.
