Many of us made a risk a while ago and chose Angularjs as our js framework.
Then the direction for Angular team for the next version came out and all of us are angry. It is
even worse talking to non techie (product, BA, etc.) people about it:

##### A year ago:

_Dev_: We need some time to invest in this new awesome framework called
Angularjs.


_Business_: (after some push back)...sure go ahead if you think it is
worth it.


_Devs_: omg Angular is awesome.

##### A month ago:
_Dev_: We will need some time in near future to rewrite our app in Angular
2.


_Business_: WTF? You were saying this is Angular thing is the best thing
ever...These developers are all crazy.

#### Migration Roadmap
But other than non-techies we are all confused about out next move. Even the Angular core team doesn't have an answer to this question. Brad Green, Angular engineering director has simply said:

And Angular 2.x doesn't exist. In [ng-conf Salt lake city](http://www.ng-conf.org/) there was a [talk](http://mzgol.github.io/slides/ng-1-meets-ng-2/#/) about this. Airbnb has a [post](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/preparing-for-the-future-of-angularjs) about this as well. During Angularru there was a [talk](https://angularu.com/ng/session/2015sf/angular-2-roadmap-update) about the raoadmap for Angular 2. At the very end of the talk (min 56 and 1:17) there are some hints about migration. In summary it comes to four action items:

* Since controllers are depricated in Angular 2, keep your view logic in modular web components
* Use ES6 or TypeScript
* Upgrade to 1.4
* Use Angular router 1.4
