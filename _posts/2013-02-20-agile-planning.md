Why planning?
------------
We are getting paid to build stuff.
The most critical risk of a project is building the wrong thing. Missing the deadline comes after that.
There are a lot of projects that deliver on time but no one cares about that because the customers are not satisfied.

Plans change all the time
-------------------------
A good plan is one that stakeholders find reliable to make decisions based on.
Changes to requirement happens. We can update the plan but we can's update the date.
Activities never finish earlier that planned.
If an story takes 2 days longer than planned this two days will get propagated on the whole plan.
The other catch is all similar estimated activities are going to be late too.
We should always remember that the estimation is not equal to committing. Estimation is just an estimation.

Release plannings are important
------------------------------
Because a sprint is not enough to deliver useful stuff a concept of release planning gets introduced.
While iteration are around two to four weeks releases are two to six months.
Experiment with ideal days vs story days and choose based on your team.
Estimation sessions can be over expensive. Just put a timer in the middle of session and planning poker should be less than two minutes.

Build process by experiments
----------------------------
For our team having two weak iterations from Monday to Thursday worked out very well. The Fridays were for demo and wrap up of current sprint.
The best way we found to deal with bugs is to fix them on the iteration they get discovered.
As far as the end date of a project is far in the future, we don't feel any pressure and work leisurely.
The project buffer should represent at least 20% of the total project duration.
Don't have partially done work: it is hard to measure and it will ruin the trust between customer and team.
Have in progress as narrow as one card to avoid having developers working on multiple tasks.
